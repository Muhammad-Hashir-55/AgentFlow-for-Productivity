- Primary color: Deep Indigo (#3F51B5) to convey focus and productivity.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F5F5F5) for a clean and distraction-free environment.
- Accent color: Muted Teal (#4CAF50) for highlighting important actions and progress indicators.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif font, for a modern, neutral, and highly readable style
- Use clear, minimalist icons from a consistent set (e.g., Material Design Icons) to represent task categories and actions.
- Implement a clean, card-based layout for tasks, visually separated by priority and status. Ensure good spacing and alignment for readability.
- Use subtle animations (e.g., task status transitions, highlighting upon selection) to provide feedback without being distracting.
